                <p>Since I was a child I was fascinated by fantasy worlds (mainly Lord of the Rings, The Witcher, Warcraft). Thanks to that for over 10 years I have been involved in various projects in this field as a co-creator or active user. Professionally, I am an office worker with almost 5 years of experience, working as Financial Broker. I am involved in my duties striving for continuous self-improvement. Thanks to my skills I work well in areas that require creativity and constant adaptation. I know how to cooperate in a large team to achieve goals together. I am looking for new professional challenges (I am currently learing programming using: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL). I will gladly join company for many years with the possibility of development in the company structure.</p>
